Key Features:-
Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the datasets and relationships.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for modeling.
Model Development: Building predictive models using supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.
Deployment: Prototyping the model for potential deployment in real-world scenarios. 

Comparison of Regression Models:-
I have also deployed an evaluate model effectiveness, multiple regression algorithms were compared. Linear Regression provided a baseline with straightforward interpretability, while advanced models like Ridge/Lasso helped reduce overfitting. Ensemble regressors such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting achieved better accuracy but at the cost of complexity. The comparison highlights which approach best balances prediction accuracy and interpretability for admission prediction.
